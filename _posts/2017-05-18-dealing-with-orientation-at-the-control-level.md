When controlling robots at the velocity kinematics (\\( \mathbf{t} = \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{q}) \mathbf{\nu} \\) where \\(\mathbf{t}\\) is a twist, \\( \mathbf{q}\\) is the vector of generalized coordinates, \\( \mathbf{\nu}\\) is the generalized velocity and \\(\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{q})\\) is the Jacobian matrix) or acceleration level, one important step is to compute an orientation error that is meaningful and can be easily related to angular velocities / accelerations. One simple way to do that is to ...
